I’m Brianna, an aspiring cybersecurity specialist passionate about protecting digital worlds
        with creativity, compassion, and determination.
</p> <p>
My journey began with a curiosity for technology and a drive to understand how systems work
        — especially how they can be protected against threats.
</p> <p>
Currently, I’m developing my skills in social engineering defense, network security, and
        ethical hacking, and I’m excited to contribute to a safer digital future.
</p> <p>
When I’m not diving into cybersecurity, I enjoy gardening, rock hounding, and spending time
        with my dogs.
