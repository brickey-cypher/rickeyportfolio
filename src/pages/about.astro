        <p>
          I’m Brianna, an aspiring cybersecurity specialist passionate about protecting digital
          worlds with creativity, compassion, and determination.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey began with a curiosity for technology and a drive to understand how systems
          work — especially how they can be protected against threats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I’m developing my skills in social engineering defense, network security, and
          ethical hacking, and I’m excited to contribute to a safer digital future.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not diving into cybersecurity, I enjoy gardening, rock hounding, and spending
          time with my dogs.
