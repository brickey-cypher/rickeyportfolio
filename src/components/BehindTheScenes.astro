      This portfolio wasn’t just built—it was carefully crafted with intention, iteration, and a
      whole lot of trial and error.

      This is a fully responsive cybersecurity portfolio website built in VS Code using Astro,
      React, and Tailwind CSS. It showcases my skills and projects through an intuitive design with
      dynamic views and smooth navigation, optimized for both mobile and desktop. I focused on
      writing clean, maintainable code and used AI tools to accelerate development while maintaining
      full understanding and control over every piece of the project.
